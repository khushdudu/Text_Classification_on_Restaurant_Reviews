2-1	"We were able to get a  table immediately around 230pm on a Wednesday.  The service was great and the food was even better. The food was made to order, cooked perfectly, and the view was worth the price. The cost of the meal averaged everywhere else, but was the first meal worth the price. Perfect place to sit for 2 hours and enjoy a few drinks."	1

2/0	"After a horrible experience a year ago we gave this place another try. The service was poor, the waitstaff were not knowledgeable about their food and not attentive whatsoever. My dinner arrived cold and overcooked. The deserts arrived half melted-as if they were plated 15 minutes before serving (not a good idea for ice cream). I should have known better after our previous experience where we needed to use the telephone to ask the staff to bring us menus and send a waiter over.....after waiting 25 minutes! The overall food quality is also lacking and needs improvement!"	0

2/0	All food tasted like the purchased it from Wal-Mart and the chef who prepared it just left his shift at McDonald's. Never again!	0
